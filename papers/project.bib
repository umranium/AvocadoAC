  abstract = {Storing and using specific instances improves the performance of several
	supervised learning algorithms. These include algorithms that learn
	decision trees, classification rules, and distributed networks. However,
	no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances
	to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a
	framework and methodology, called instance-based learning, that generates
	classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based
	learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived
	from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor
	algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how
	storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most,
	minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While
	the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world
	databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute
	noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance
	test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance
	degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably
	with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this work, algorithms are developed and evaluated to detect physical
	activities from data acquired using five small biaxial accelerometers
	worn simultaneously on different parts of the body. Acceleration
	data was collected from 20 subjects without researcher supervision
	or observation. Subjects were asked to perform a sequence of everyday
	tasks but not told specifically where or how to do them. Mean, energy,
	frequency-domain entropy, and correlation of acceleration data was
	calculated and several classifiers using these features were tested.
	Decision tree classifiers showed the best performance recognizing
	everyday activities with an overall accuracy rate of 84\%. The results
	show that although some activities are recognized well with subject-independent
	training data, others appear to require subject-specific training
	data. The results suggest that multiple accelerometers aid in recognition
	because conjunctions in acceleration feature values can effectively
	discriminate many activities. With just two biaxial accelerometers
	– thigh and wrist – the recognition performance dropped only slightly.
	This is the first work to investigate performance of recognition

  abstract = {Abstract. The recognition of abstract high-level activities using
	wearable sensors is an important prerequisite for context aware mobile
	assistance, especially in AAL and medical care applications. A major
	difficulty in detecting this type of activities is that different
	activities often share similar motion patterns. One possible solution
	is to aggregate these activities from shorter, easier to detect base
	level actions, but the explicit annotation of these is not trivial
	and very time consuming. In this paper we introduce a simple clustering
	based method for the recognition of compound activities at a high
	level of abstraction using k-Means as an unsupervised learning algorithm.
	A general problem of these methods is that the resulting cluster
	affiliations are typically not human readable and some kind of interpretation
	is needed. To achieve this, we developed a hybrid approach using
	a generative probabilistic model built on top of the clusterer. We
	adapted a Hidden Markov Model for mapping the cluster memberships
	onto high-level activities and sucessfully evaluated the feasibility
	of this technique using experimental data from two test runs of a
	home care scenario showing a higher accuracy and robustness than
	conventional discriminative methods.},

	a survey study about the places people go. BeaconPrint is over 90\%
	accurate in learning and recognizing places. Additionally, it improves
	accuracy in recognizing places visited infrequently or for short
	durations - a category where previous approaches have fared poorly.

	of human movements using an accelerometry monitoring system is introduced.
	The framework was structured around a binary decision tree in which
	movements were divided into classes and subclasses at different hierarchical
	levels. General distinctions between movements were applied in the
	top levels, and successively more detailed subclassifications were
	made in the lower levels of the tree. The structure was modular and
	flexible: parts of the tree could be reordered, pruned or extended,
	without the remainder of the tree being affected. This framework
	was used to develop a classifier to identify basic movements from
	the signals obtained from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer.
	The movements were first divided into activity and rest. The activities
	were classified as falls, walking, transition between postural orientations,
	or other movement. The postural orientations during rest were classified
	as sitting, standing or lying. In controlled laboratory studies in
	which 26 normal, healthy subjects carried out a set of basic movements,
	the sensitivity of every classification exceeded 87\%, and the specificity
	exceeded 94\%; the overall accuracy of the system, measured as the

	we use social identity theory to motivate why some locations really
	are significant to the user. We also discuss what potential uses
	for location information social identity theory implies. Another
	flaw in the existing work is that most of the proposed methods are
	not suited to realistic mobile settings as they rely on the availability

	rapid response to feedback from field evaluations. The developers
	also studied other applications as well as general mobility issues.
	Their work resulted in prioritized design goals, including an emphasis
	on context, unobtrusiveness, truthfulness, seamfulness, timeliness
	and fast interaction. These design goals have been realized in several
	robust components running on top of the Series 60 Smartphone platform.
	These components include basic services like error recovery and service
	starting, sensors for gathering context data, communication channels
	for interacting with the outside world, and customizable versions
	of the Smartphone applications. Several real-world applications have
	been built on top of ContextPhone and the platform is released under
	an open-source license for use in further research.},

	in the same way graphical widgets mediate between the user and the
	application. We illustrate the concept of context widgets with the
	beginnings of a widget library we have developed for sensing presence,

	of our approach with two example context-enabled applications we

	Background Boosting is a general method which attempts to \&\#034;boost\&\#034;

	in a theoretical framework for studying machine learning called the
	\&\#034;PAC\&\#034; learning model, due to Valiant [37]; see Kearns
	and Vazirani [24] for a good introduction to this model. Kearns and
	Valiant [22, 23] were the first to pose the question of whether a
	\&\#034;weak\&\#034; learning algorithm which performs just slightly
	better than random guessing in the PAC model can be \&\#034;boosted\&\#034;
